- In Kubernetes, the ClusterIP Service is used for Pod-to-Pod communication within the same cluster. This means that a client running outside of the cluster, such as a user accessing an application over the internet, cannot directly access a ClusterIP Service.

- The NodePort Service provides a way to expose your application to external clients. An external client is anyone who is trying to access your application from outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

**Note: For the Service to connect to the Pod, you need to add a label to the Pod's metadata. Here's an updated version of the Pod YAML that includes the required label:**


This is pod.yaml
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-nginx-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

`service.yaml`:
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: my-nginx-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
